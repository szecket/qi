Text: Thug cat i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun. Have my breakfast spaghetti yarn chase mice, for sleep nap cough furball pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms toy mouse squeak roll over. Scratch the box slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish attack feet, but kitten is playing with dead mouse, and sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter.
