Text: Damir Sudar, M.S. is the Chief Science Officer at Quantitative Imaging Systems, Inc. (Qi) and holds Visiting Scientist appointments at Oregon Health & Science University and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). He graduated from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands where he received formal education in image analysis methodologies and did his graduate work on applications of microscopy and image analysis in biomedical research. Following post-doctoral work at the University of California in San Francisco, he continued research in biomedical applications of fluorescence microscopy and imaging at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and LBNL. He co-developed groundbreaking analytics for Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) and Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH). At LBNL he was instrumental in establishing a microscopy center, research in transcription regulation in complex organisms, and he moved into a leadership position as the deputy of the Life Sciences Division. During his career, he worked at Cellomics (now ThermoFisher) on high-content imaging and at a start-up on novel 3D imaging technology. He joined Qi in 2015 and develops automated microscopy techniques, image data processing and analysis software, and image data management systems. He is interested in integrating imaging modalities over multiple spatial, temporal, and functional/structural scales.
