Michel Nederlof is a physicist with 30+ years of experience in digital imaging microscopy for life sciences, ranging from fundamental technological developments, to advanced image analysis, drug development platforms and clinical applications. His academic career started at Max Planck Institute and Carnegie Mellon University. He continued to found six biotechnology companies that have created pioneering products in the areas of microscopy research, pharmaceutical drug discovery, and clinical diagnostics. They include Biological Detection Systems, which commercialized the Cyanine fluorescent dyes and created the MultiMode automated microscope, the first commercially available microscope with a cooled CCD camera. Cellomics pioneered High Content Screening (HCS) with groundbreaking systems, software and assays for the pharmaceutical industry. QED Imaging propelled digital camera technology into the field of biological research, and by integrating customized software and microscopy automation, created hundreds of the worlds most advanced microscopy systems.
At Qi, he remains hands-on and oversees all technical developments on software as well as microscope and reagent integration.
